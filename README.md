Prosper Loan Data Visualization
###About
Prosper is a peer-to-peer lending platform that aims to connect borrowers and lenders in different occupations through the integration of crowdfunding. In this data 
analysis project, I have explored the Prosper dataset and used Tableau to create my visualizations with a key focus on Defaulters, the relationship between repayment and employment 
status and ratings

###Dataset
The Prosper loan data set contains 113,937 loans with 81 variables on each loan, including loan amount, borrower rate (or interest rate), current loan status, borrower income, and many others. The dataset and data-dictionary can be found on below links.

Prosper Loan Data - VariableDefinitions - https://github.com/jubins/Tableau-Projects/blob/master/ProsperLoanData/data/ProsperLoanData-VariableDefinitions.csv

I worked to answer the following questions:

1. Relationship between the stakeholders; what affects borrowers, who default most. 
2. The reasons for defaults
3. Relationships between groups borrower and default rates 
4. Ratings for Incomes and losses 

###Summary
From the Analysis, it is observed that Debt to Income Ratio was the main reason why most people defaulted with 1,758 people. This shows that people with a bad debt to income ratio are 
most likely to default on their loans. It was alos observed that Professionals, Executives and sales people had the highest defaulted amount, this could be most likely due to the fact that highest amounts 
borrowed was also found in this occupations. From the ProsperRating(numeric) analysis, it is observed that loan categories with an estimated high return had the highestest
estimated loss. The final analysis showed that employed people, followed by full-time and self employed have a higher chance of repayment than the retired, part-time and 
not-employed. This could be due to the fact that most people in employment have a consistent salary and tend to have standing orders in place towards loan repayments.
